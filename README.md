# Secure Electronic Health Record Exchange

## Overview
This project implements a blockchain-based solution for secure exchange of electronic health records (EHRs). The system enables seamless yet controlled sharing of medical information between healthcare providers while maintaining patient privacy, data security, and regulatory compliance.

## Core Components

### Patient Identity Contract
Manages secure healthcare identifiers through privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques. Creates a consistent patient identity across the healthcare ecosystem without exposing sensitive personal information, giving patients control over their digital health identity.

### Provider Verification Contract
Validates the legitimacy of healthcare entities by recording licensing information, credentials, and institutional affiliations. Establishes a trusted network of verified healthcare providers with cryptographic proof of professional status and authority.

### Record Access Contract
Controls permissions for viewing and updating medical data based on patient consent and provider role. Implements fine-grained access controls that allow patients to specify exactly which providers can access specific portions of their medical records and for what duration.

### Audit Trail Contract
Tracks all access to sensitive health information with immutable records of who accessed what data, when, and for what purpose. Creates a comprehensive and tamper-proof log that supports compliance requirements while enabling patients to monitor their data usage.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure your blockchain environment
4. Deploy the contracts
5. Integrate with existing healthcare systems

## Architecture
The solution uses a privacy-focused design with contracts that maintain the confidentiality of medical records while enabling authorized sharing. Patient data remains encrypted and fragmented, with access controlled through cryptographic keys.

## Security Considerations
- End-to-end encryption for all health data
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification
- Secure key management for patient and provider access
- Emergency access protocols for critical care situations

## Compliance
This solution is designed to meet healthcare regulations including:
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- HITECH Act requirements
- Regional health data protection laws
